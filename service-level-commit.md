# Purchasing services deployed on-premises
{: #service-comit}

You can commit to spend a set amount on one or more on-premises services over a specific period and enjoy discounts in return. If you expect to generate a large amount of usage for services deployed on-premises, like {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} or {{site.data.keyword.IBMz}}, you might want to consider purchasing services this way.

Your on-premises usage data is sent to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} when you order hardware through a service-level commitment, which allows you to monitor hardware usage alongside your cloud-based usage. Gain a complete view of your resource usage trends across both on-premises and cloud environments to help you make informed decisions.



Commitments include a term, discount rate, and total commitment amount. You might also have a monthly or yearly minimum spend if applicable. A term might be 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years. For example, you might have a commitment with the following provisions:
- 1-year term
- 30% discount on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
- $120,000 total commitment
- $1,000 minimum usage per month

All of your service usage is discounted with a service-level commitment, even if you exceed your commitment amount.

## Before you begin
{: #before-service-commit}

- You can have commitments for services that are deployed on-premises only in an individual account, such as a stand-alone account or an account within an enterprise.
- Service-level commitments cannot be shared across multiple accounts.
- Commitments for services that are deployed on-premises include a one-time installation charge.
- The discount that you receive with a service-level commitment does not combine with other discounts, such as account-level discounts from an Enterprise Savings Plan or a Subscription. Your usage counts toward only one commitment at a time, and a service-level commitment supersedes an account-level discount.



## Signing up for a commitment
{: #signup-slc}

Most account types can order a service-level commitment. Work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to create a commitment quote based on the spending amount for the period that you want to commit to.

You can have multiple commitments for different services active at the same time.
{: note}

After you accept the commitment quote, you receive an email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment is added to your account.




## Viewing your commitment usage
{: #slc-services}

To view your service-level commitment usage, go to **Manage > Billing and usage > Commitments** and click **Service-level commitments**. To access this information, you need an access policy with the viewer role or higher on the billing account management service.

## Minimum spending
{: #spending-min-slc}

Multi-year terms have a required yearly minimum spend. You might also have a monthly minimum spend for a commitment, which depends on your commitment amount. If you don't meet the monthly or yearly minimum usage, you are charged up to the minimum remaining amount. To make sure that you're using resources at a rate that fulfills your commitment, go to the Service-level commitments page and click a commitment. Here you can view a more detailed breakdown of your usage.



Set a spending notification to make sure that your usage is on track to fulfill your commitment. For more information, see [Setting spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending).
