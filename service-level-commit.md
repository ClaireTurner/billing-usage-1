# Service-level commitments
{: #service-comit}

With service-level commitments, you commit to spend a certain amount on a specific service or group of services and receive discounts based on your commitment. If you expect to generate a large amount of usage for a service, {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} or {{site.data.keyword.IBMz}}, you might want to consider purchasing services this way.

All of your service usage is discounted with a service-level commitment, even if you exceed your commitment amount.
{: note}

Commitments include a term, discount rate, total commitment amount, a monthly minimum spend, and yearly minimum spend if applicable. For example, you might have a commitment with the following provisions:
- 1 year term
- 30% discount on PowerVS
- $120,000 total commitment
- $1,000 minimum usage per month

## Before you begin
{: #before-service-commit}

- Only in an individual account, such as standalone account or an account within an enterprise, can you have commitments for on-premises usage.
- Service-level commitments cannot be shared across multiple accounts.
- Commitments for on-premises services include a one-time installation charge.
- Commitments start at $1,000 minimum usage per month

## Signing up for a commitment
{: #signup-slc}

All account types, including trial accoutns, can order a service-level commitment. Work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to create a commitment quote based on the spending amount for the period that you want to commit to.

You can have multiple commitments for different catalog services active at the same time.
{: note}

After you accept the commitment quote, you receive an email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment is added to your account.

## Viewing your commitment usage
{: #slc-services}

To view your service-level commitment usage, go to **Manage > Billing > Commitments** and click **Service-level commitments**. To access this information, you need an access policy with the viewer role or higher on the billing account management service.

## Minimum spending
{: #spending-min-slc}

The monthly minimum spend for all commitments depends on your commitment amount and your utilization to date. Multi-year commitments also have a yearly minimum. If you don't meet the monthly or yearly minimum usage, you are charged the remaining amount. To make sure that you're using resources at a rate that fulfills your commitment, go to the Service-level commitments page and click a commitment. Here you can view a more detailed breakdown of your usage.

Set a spending notification to make sure that your usage is on track to fulfill your commitment. For more information, see [Setting spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending).
