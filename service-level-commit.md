# Service-level commitments
{: #service-comit}





With service-level commitments, you commit to spend a certain amount on a specific service or group of services and receive discounts based on your commitment. If you expect to generate a large amount of usage for a service, like {{site.data.keyword.powerSysFull}} or {{site.data.keyword.IBMz}}, you might want to consider purchasing services this way.





All of your service usage is discounted with a service-level commitment, even if you exceed your commitment amount.
{: note}

Commitments include a term, discount rate, and total commitment amount. You might also have a monthly or yearly minimum spend if applicable. A term might be 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years. For example, you might have a commitment with the following provisions:
- 1-year term
- 30% discount on {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}}
- $120,000 total commitment
- $1,000 minimum usage per month

## Before you begin
{: #before-service-commit}

- You can have commitments for services deployed on-premises only in an individual account, such as standalone account or an account within an enterprise.
- Service-level commitments cannot be shared across multiple accounts.
- Commitments for services deployed on-premises include a one-time installation charge.

## Signing up for a commitment
{: #signup-slc}

Most account types can order a service-level commitment. Work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule){: external} to create a commitment quote based on the spending amount for the period that you want to commit to.

You can have multiple commitments for different catalog services active at the same time.
{: note}

After you accept the commitment quote, you receive an email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment is added to your account.

## Viewing your commitment usage
{: #slc-services}

To view your service-level commitment usage, go to **Manage > Billing and usage > Commitments** and click **Service-level commitments**. To access this information, you need an access policy with the viewer role or higher on the billing account management service.

## Minimum spending
{: #spending-min-slc}

Multi-year terms have a required yearly minimum spend. You might also have a monthly minimum spend for a commitment, which depends on your commitment amount. If you don't meet the monthly or yearly minimum usage, you are charged up to the minimum remaining amount. To make sure that you're using resources at a rate that fulfills your commitment, go to the Service-level commitments page and click a commitment. Here you can view a more detailed breakdown of your usage.



Set a spending notification to make sure that your usage is on track to fulfill your commitment. For more information, see [Setting spending notifications](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending).
