# FAQs for invoices
{: #invoice-faq}

Review the following FAQs to find helpful information about invoices. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](https://{DomainName}/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}

## Where can I access my invoice?
{: #access-invoices}
{: faq}
{: support}

If you have a billable account, you can access your invoice by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. If you have a Lite account, you don't have an invoice because you're never charged for Lite plan usage.

For Pay-As-You-Go accounts that aren't billed in US dollars or Subscription accounts, you can also view your invoices on the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/invoices){: external}. See [How do I view invoices for Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription accounts?](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-ts_cant-view-invoice) and [Viewing your invoices](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-managing-invoices) for more information.

## Why does my usage not match my invoice?
{: #usage-not-match-invoice}
{: faq}
{: support}

Your usage might not match your invoice because the months that are used to compare usage aren't the same, or the total amount of the orgs wasn't selected. For more information, see [Viewing your usage](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-viewingusage). If it still doesn't match, get in touch with us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and choosing the third option, or by opening a [support case](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}.

## Why can't I manage my invoices?
{: #slperm-manage-invoices}
{: faq}

The SoftLayer permission for managing invoices might not have been migrated correctly in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Ask your account owner to add you to the View account summary access group. For more information, see [Managing migrated SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-migrated_permissions).

## How can I download my invoice?

For Pay-As-You-Go accounts that aren't billed in US dollars or Subscription accounts, you can download your invoices on the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/invoices){: external}. From the Invoices page, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select the invoice format.

## Is paperless invoicing available? 
{: #paperless-invoices}
{: faq}

Yes, you can switch to paperless invoices by submitting a request on the [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Customer Support site](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/zz/en/selectcountrylang.html). For more information, see [Requesting paperless invoices](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-managing-invoices#request-paperless-invoices).

## What are the adjustments that are shown on my invoice? 
{: #adjustments-invoices}
{: faq}

The adjustments section of your current invoice includes charges or credits from previous billing periods that weren't included on your previous invoice.

## How do I know if my invoice is paid? 
{: #paid-invoices}
{: faq}

If you manage your invoices through the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Console, you can see the invoice status by clicking **Manage > Billing and usage**, and selecting **Invoices**. When the invoice is paid, the status is `Closed`. If your invoices are managed through the [IBM Invoices website](https://www.ibm.com/invoices){: external}, it's paid when the status is `Settled`.
