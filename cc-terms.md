# Carbon calculator terms
{: #carbon-calc-terms}

The following are the terms used within the [carbon calculator documentation](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-what-is-cloud-calc) and [methodology PDF](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/downloads/billing-usage/carbon-calc-method-v2.pdf){: external}.


Business Organization
:   Divisions, groups, functions, or business units that are a part of IBM or a Covered Entity.

Contracted Renewable Energy
:   Renewable Energy that IBM, or a third-party (e.g., a landlord) on behalf of IBM specifically contracts for from an energy provider, broker or renewable energy project developer, whether delivered through the grid or generated at an IBM Location.

Cost Avoidance
:   Actions that reduce energy cost. Examples include rate negotiations with energy providers; implementing peak-shaving techniques; participation in demand reduction programs, purchasing electricity at higher voltages, fuel cell installations, value add tax recovery, or purchasing energy on longer term, fixed price contracts. Transfer of mission from one site to another do not readily qualify as Cost Avoidance. Specific actions must be identified and taken by the energy management team that resulted in energy cost avoidance for the operations and/or activities being transferred to record a cost avoidance savings.

Covered Entity (or Entities)
:   Joint business ventures, subsidiaries, and companies as defined in CI ENV 201.

Energy
:   Electricity, fuels and Purchased Energy Commodities used to operate facilities. For the purpose of this CI, it does not include energy used for transportation or similar activities.

Energy Conservation
:   Actions that avoid or reduce consumption of energy or improve operational energy efficiency. The results need to be supported by measurements and/or calculations based upon actual operating conditions. Examples of Energy Conservation actions include: using  building monitoring and/or management and control software to optimize Energy Consumption; installing efficient lighting and cooling for buildings; using night setbacks on equipment; using variable frequency drives, replacing boilers or chillers and other infrastructure upgrades; optimizing efficiency through maintenance or operational actions; consolidating and virtualizing IT systems; reducing data center cooling delivery; raising IT equipment inlet temperatures.

    Another example of Energy Conservation involves more efficient use of existing space and assets while maintaining the same general business mission and production output. In order to report Energy Conservation savings, specific actions must be taken by the local energy management team when moving or consolidating activities into more energy efficient space (e.g., office space, data centers), provided that there is no associated reduction in business mission and Energy Conservation can be demonstrated when normalized against applicable operational parameters.  Energy reduction due to downsizing or restructuring activities such as building shutdown, ramping down or outsourcing of operations do not qualify as energy conservation.


    For the purposes of this CI, savings from Energy Conservation shall only be applied to a maximum duration of one continuous 12-month period, which may span across two calendar years. Energy savings may be prorated for each calendar year if month-to-month savings are consistent (e.g., a lighting project) or reported monthly where savings differ or are absent in some months based on the time of year (e.g., a free cooling or chiller optimization project).

Energy Conservation Assessment
:   An evaluation of the current operational practices and facility system installations to determine the opportunities to reduce Energy Consumption or improve energy efficiency by modifying operational practices, installing new or modifying existing equipment. For the purposes of this CI, Energy Conservation Assessments required must be completed using the "Energy Conservation Surveys".


Energy Conservation Surveys
:   Standards and completed best practice surveys maintained in the IBM Energy Management Tool.

Energy Consumption
:   Quantity of energy applied per unit of time to perform work.

Energy Efficiency
:   Ratio or other quantitative relationship between an output of performance, service, goods, commodities, or energy, and an input of energy.  This can be used to demonstrate how effectively energy is used.

Energy Intensive Operations
:   For the purposes of this CI, these include but are not limited to data centers, software and hardware labs, manufacturing and assembly, and research operations.

Energy Management
:   Activities associated with managing the Energy Consumption, Energy Use and efficiency, Energy Conservation, cost and procurement of Energy across IBM's business.

Energy Use
:   Manner or kind of application of energy to generate work. Examples include lighting, heating and cooling of buildings, manufacturing, and data center operations.


Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
:   Gaseous substance that, when released to the atmosphere, has a warming effect on Earth.

Grid Region
:   A territory within which electricity can physically flow from point of generation to point of consumption.  IBM follows the definition by the U.S. Energy Information Administration 1 for electric grids and their operations.  Grid region is sometimes referred to as "balancing authority". The same concept is applied for other jurisdictions.

Grid-supplied Renewable Energy
:   Renewable Energy provided to IBM by a utility company, energy retailer or other energy suppliers as part of their regular grid power supply portfolio under IBM's routine purchasing activities. For the purposes of this CI, this kind of Renewable Energy must not be reported as Contracted Renewable Energy in the IBM Energy Management Tool. Grid-supplied Renewable Energy consumed at IBM Locations will be determined by Corporate Environmental Affairs.

IBM Energy Management Tool
:   IBM's enterprise tool for inputting, storing, tracking and reporting data for Energy Consumption, Energy Conservation, cost, Cost Avoidance, and Renewable Energy projects and purchases.

IBM Location
:   Any location that is owned, leased or managed by a Business Organization including but not limited to, administrative offices; data centers; software and hardware labs; manufacturing, development, and research facilities; distribution locations; dismantling and scrapping centers. For the purposes of this CI, the term IBM Location includes all the following:

    - **IBM Owned Location**: The real estate is owned by IBM or a Covered Entity.
    - **IBM Leased Location**: The real estate is not owned by IBM or a Covered Entity but is occupied in part or whole by IBM or a Covered Entity who is a tenant under contractual agreement with the owner of such real estate.
        - **Co-location Data Centers**: An IBM Data Center where, as part of the lease agreement, IBM receives from the landlord infrastructure services (e.g., chilled water, lighting, heating and ventilating, procurement of electricity and other utilities, bandwidth, and physical security), over which IBM does not execute control. IBM owns, installs, operates and maintains the servers, storage and networking systems and associated support infrastructure within the leased space of a Co-location Data Center.
    - **IBM Managed Location**: An IBM Owned or Leased Location where IBM, a Covered Entity, or their contracted service providers operate and/or manage all energy consuming activities at the facility.

    IBM Locations are classified as follows:

    - Tier 1 Locations: IBM Locations where IBM's annual Energy Consumption is equal to or greater than 12,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) based on the previous calendar year's consumption2
    - Tier 2 Locations: IBM Locations where IBM's annual Energy Consumption is equal to or greater than 500MWh and less than 12,000 MWh based on the previous calendar year's consumption3
    - Tier 3 Locations: all other IBM Locations

Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
:   Ratio of the data center total energy consumption to information technology equipment energy consumption, calculated, measured or assessed across the same period.

Purchased Energy Commodities
:   Steam, chilled water and hot water generated by a third-party and supplied to an IBM Location.

Renewable Energy
:   Energy sources that are naturally replenishing but which may be flow-limited, including biomass, biogas, bioethanol, hydro-power, solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, wind power, geothermal, ocean thermal, wave action, and tidal action.

Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)
:   A tradable instrument that represents the property right of non-energy environmental attribute (e.g., zero emissions) of 1 MWh of renewable electricity generation. A REC is referred to as a "Guarantee of Origin" (GoO) in the European Union.

Site Operations Management
:   For the purposes of this CI, it includes any Business Organization responsible for managing facility operations and/or energy systems at an IBM Location, either directly or through a service provider or equivalent. The Site Operations Management organization may report to Global Real Estate or another Business Organization.

Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates
:   RECs which are separated from the renewable electricity generation in one Grid Region and used to offset consumption of conventionally generated electricity in another Grid Region.
