# Moving to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs
{: #migrate-to-partner1}

Any SoftLayer Partner that signed the following agreements prior to May 2021 is required to sign an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Agreement and create a new {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} order by 31 October 2024:
- SoftLayer Reseller Agreement
- Federal Resell Program Addendum
- SoftLayer Solution & Service Provider Attachment (SSSPA) to the CSA
- IBM Cloud Enterprise Service Agreement (ESA) Click & Accept

Moving to IBM Partner Programs requires a new IBM Resell or ESA order. All IBM Business Partners are required to join [IBM Partner Plus](https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/){: external}. --> so does this mean that all SoftLayer Partners will have to join Partner Plus?

Migrating your Softlayer account or accounts to an IBM account is also a requirement. --> does this mean that they will get totally new accounts and account IDs?

Direct accounts (?) must have all invoices fully paid before moving to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs. To pay your invoice in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. Review the following sections to understand the changes that apply to only partners.
