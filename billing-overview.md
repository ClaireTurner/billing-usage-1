{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers multiple billing options so you can tailor how you pay based on your resource usage and your organization's procurement practices. You get the most flexibility with a Pay-As-You-Go account. You pay only for the billable services that you use each month, with no long-term contracts or commitments. If you know you'll have a significant amount of usage, you can purchase a subscription to get a discount. With a subscription, you commit to a certain amount of usage over a given period of time. The larger the subscription, the better the discount. You can choose to pay upfront or be billed monthly, quarterly, or annually.

As an account owner, you have full access to monitoring resource usage, viewing invoices, and managing payments in the console. However, if you want to delegate billing tasks to another user, you can assign a user an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service.

When you're ready to start tracking your resource usage and managing your billing and payment preferences, go to the Billing and usage section of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Monitoring resource usage can help you understand what's coming in your next bill. On the Usage page, you can view current and past usage, and drill down by resource type to view the plans and instances in your account. 

You can also export usage reports and choose from a high-level summary overview or a service instance view. If you use tags to organize your resources such as by team or cost center, you can sort your instance report by the tags to identify the associated usage.

Setting spending limits is another helpful way to keep an eye on usage in your account. You can set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending. When you reach a percentage of the spending limit that you set, you'll be notified immediately by email.

To view your current balance, manage your payment method, or make a one-time payment, go to the Payments page. You can download your latest invoice with all discounts and charges here or from the Invoices page. 

Now that you've walked through the common billing options and how to delegate billing administrator capabilities, track usage, and pay your bill, you're ready to start making decisions that are best for your account. As always, if you need more information, check out the documentation for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} billing and usage.
