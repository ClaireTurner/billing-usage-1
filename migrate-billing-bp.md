{: #before-moveing-partners}

- Usage is now billed from the first to the last day of each month, with a single, consolidated invoice issued on the 8th of the following month.
- During the transition to this new billing cycle, you might see prorated charges for services that are billed on different schedules. For example, you might have monthly infrastructure services that are billed in advance, hourly usage products that are billed one month in arrears, or platform resources that are billed two months in arrears. The new billing cycle aligns all services to a one-month in arrears model.
- The business entity and credit card merchant that is used to bill your account is changing, so the company name that is displayed on your credit card statement will change.
- All discounts on all services are removed as part of the move to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs. You can negociate discounts as part of the order process.
- If you have flex credits and promo credits remaining in an account, they are added to your new account after your move to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs.
- If you have support entitlements remaining in an account, they are added to your new account after your move to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs.
- Direct accounts (?) must have all invoices fully paid before moving to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Partner Programs.
