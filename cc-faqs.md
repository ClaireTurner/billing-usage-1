# FAQs for IBM Cloud Carbon Calculator
{: #carboncalcfaqs}

## Why can't I see my emissions data?
{: #carboncalc-emissions}
{: faq}

You might not be able to view your accounts emissions data because you don't have the right access or the service doesn't have enough data. For access, account owners, account administrators, and users with a viewer role or higher on the billing service can view and export emissions data for the entire account. Supported services must have at least 30 days of data to be viewed on the carbon calculator.

<!--If you have the right access and still can't view data, there's some minimum requirements that your account needs. To view emissions data your account must be open for a minimum of 31 days and monthly usage must be higher than $250 USD. If you have a free account or your usage is less than $250 USD, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} might require a minimum number of service types to calculate and show emissions data.-->

If you're still having issues viewing data, [create a support case](/unifiedsupport/cases/form) in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support Center.

## How do you calculate the emissions?
{: #calculate-emissions}
{: faq}

The total emissions are calculated by comparing the energy-related usage with data center energy sources. Emissions from key greenhouse gases are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (kgCO~2~e). You can download the total emissions data in CSV format. View the total emissions widget on the [Carbon Calculator](/billing/carbon-calculator) page in the console.
