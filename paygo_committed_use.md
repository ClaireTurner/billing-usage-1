# Pay as you go with Committed Use billing model 
{: #committed-use}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Pay as you go with Committed Use billing model is similar to the billing model for Subscription accounts but with a few added benefits. With this billing model, you commit to spend a certain amount on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and receive discounts across the platform. You are billed monthly based on your usage and you continue to receive a discount even after you reach your committed amount. 
{: shortdesc}

For more information about the availability of the billing model in your location, contact [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Sales](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?contactmodule){: external}. 
{: note}

The Commitments and subscriptions page in the console offers a view of any active or upcoming commitments. If you have an active subscription, or had subscriptions in the past, those details are also displayed on this page.

## Signing up for a commitment 
{: #sign-up-commit}

To leverage the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Pay as you go with Committed Use billing model, you must work with [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?contactmodule){: external} to sign up for this billing model. The sales team creates a commitment quote based on the spending amount for a certain period of time you want to commit to. 

After you accept the commitment quote, you receive an additional email to confirm that your payment information is processed and that the commitment is added to your account. 

## Viewing your commitment quote 
{: #committed-view}

After you contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?contactmodule){: external} and sign up for a commitment, you receive a quote. The commitment quote details your contract period, duration of the commitment, billing frequency, UOM, discount, and commitment terms. The sales team will email you a copy of your quote.

## Viewing your commitment usage 
{: #committed-usage}

The Commitments and subscriptions page provides the usage details for any commitment on the account. You can track your usage month-to-month for a detailed view of your commitment usage history. To access this information, you need an access policy with the viewer role or higher on the billing account management service. See [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles) for more information.

To view your platform and service subscription usage in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Commitments and subscriptions**.

* Click the tabs to view information about active or upcoming commitments. Active commitments are commitments that still have a remaining committed amount to spend and time that's left in the commitment term. Upcoming commitments are commitments that were added to the account but haven't yet reached their term period. A commitment is inactive if its term expires or all of its committed amount is spent.
* Use the graph to view what you've spent toward your overall committed amount. You can view the days remaining in the commitment, discount, billing method, and billing frequency.
* View a monthly breakdown of the spending history for the commitment. Monthly spending is broken out by month. You can manage your commitment by viewing any change in spending month-to-month and by viewing your spending trends over time.

## Remaining commitment 
{: #unmet-commit}

If you don't spend the total committed amount by the end of the commitment term, you are invoiced for the amount that you didn't consume. The graph on the Commitments and subscriptions page provides details about what you've spent toward your overall committed amount, so you can easily track what you've consumed and how much time is left in your commitment.

## Service-level discounts
{: #service-discount-commit}

In addition to the platform-level discount applied to a commitment, you can receive additional discounts that apply to a service. Discounts on services vary depending on your account type. To view the discounts that are applied to your commitment in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Commitments and subscriptions**. In the discounts section, use the table to view your active discounts. 
 
Multiple discounts can't be applied to a single resource.
