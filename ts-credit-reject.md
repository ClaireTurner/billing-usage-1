# Why was my credit card transaction rejected?
{: #trans-rejected}
{: troubleshoot}

Protecting your identity is a priority and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} takes credit card verification seriously.
{: shortdesc}

An issue occurred that caused the transaction to fail. For example, the name and address on file with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} doesn't match the information on file with the company that issued your credit card. This error might prompt the following message:
{: tsSymptoms}

`Error: Could not place order. Problem authorizing the credit card. We are unable to process your request: Transaction Rejected`

Something went wrong when verifying your credit card, and the transaction wasn't successful.
{: tsCauses}

To ensure that your credit card verification is successful, complete the following steps:
{: tsResolve}

1. Verify that the name and address for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account matches the name and address on file with your credit card issuer.
2. Verify that the country associated with a VAT or tax identification number matches the country in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. For example, a VAT ID registered in France can't be associated with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that is registered in Finland. 
3. Verify that you are creating a business account and not a personal account if you are specifying a VAT ID or tax identification number. 
4. Review the error message that was displayed. If your transaction was rejected and an email address was not provided, contact your credit card issuer.
5. Contact us by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.
