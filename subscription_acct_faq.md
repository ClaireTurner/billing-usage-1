For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

You might be looking for information about promo codes and feature codes, which are available for certain account types. For more information, see [Managing promotions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-applying-promo-codes) and [Applying feature codes to Lite accounts](/docs/billing-usage?topic=account-codes).

## Can I spend more or less than my monthly commitment?

A subscription is a contract between you and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} that commits you to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for a specific term and spending amount. You can request to cancel your subscription before the end of the term, but whether the subscription can be canceled is at the discretion of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Any remaining credit on your subscription might be forfeited. For more information, contact [Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter){: external}. Make sure that you provide details about why you need to cancel your subscription.
